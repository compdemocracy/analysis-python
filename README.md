# Polis Analysis Notebooks, Python

This (WIP) repository contains code for analyzing Polis conversation data in Jupyter notebooks.

## Usage

We recommend installing pyenv to install python3. From there in the root of this directory:

1. Create a virtual environment (it will be automatically ignored if it's called `analysis-env`) `pyenv virtualenv ./analysis-env`
2. Activate the virtual environment `source analysis-venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `jupyter notebook`

There are two datasets included. Please note the CompDem open data repository on this Github account contains more examples of Polis conversations.
